# SEO Content Generator - Spreadsheet-Style Web App

## Overview

I've successfully built a comprehensive web application for programmatic SEO that looks and functions like a spreadsheet. The application allows you to input keywords and automatically generate content briefs, article titles, and complete articles through an intuitive interface.

## Features

### ✅ Spreadsheet-Like Interface

### ✅ Two-Step Content Generation Process
1. **Generate Brief & Title**: Input a keyword and click "Generate Brief" to create a content brief and article title
2. **Write Article**: Click "Write Article" to generate a complete, comprehensive article based on the brief and title

### ✅ Real-Time Status Updates
- Visual status badges showing progress for each keyword
- Loading states with animated spinners during content generation
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

- Built with React and modern UI components (shadcn/ui)

- Smooth animations and hover effects
- Clean, modern styling with Tailwind CSS
